# üëã Introduction

The very principle of this system is to allow you to create ‚Äòmodules‚Äô.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is a module ?

This is a group of functions of the same nature or type, or functions that are supposed to work together
to create something more complex.

For example, the /kick, /ban and /mute commands could be grouped together in a module called ‚ÄòModeration‚Äô.

Another example: imagine a panel (embed) with a ‚Äòcontact staff‚Äô button, which opens a new channel with just
you and the staff. This is what is usually called a ‚Äòticket module‚Äô, which makes it easy to contact a server's
staff in a private room.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements 

If you haven't already cloned the [Module Template](https://github.com/LeWeeky/Module-template-for-clappybot),
you should do so, as it contains a bunch of examples that will make it much easier to create your own.
You can do this by copying and pasting the following command: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeWeeky/Module-template-for-clappybot.git sources/modules/template
```
