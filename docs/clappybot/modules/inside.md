# ðŸ”Ž Have a see inside

There is a lot of files inside ` sources/modules/templates ` but let's see what it all adds up to.

The only mandatory file for your module to be considered valid is `data.json` all the others are
completely optional, if you don't need them you can delete them. This is where you define the name
of the module, the emoji and the description, as shown below :
```json
{
	"title":
		"Template",
	"emoji":
		"ðŸ‘¤",
	"description":
		"A module that serves as an example!"
}
```

`data.json` â†’ name, emoji and description for the module

`init.js` â†’ any functions to be started when the bot is launched to initialise the module

`utils` â†’ You will notice that there is a `utils` folder, which is not automatically imported by the system, it is a totally optional folder which can have any other name (it doesn't matter) in which you save functions, classes or anything else that can be used in your module

Each folder can contain as many files as necessary, please take care for folders that manage several
events (for example: create, update and delete events) to add the extension corresponding to the event
in question (channel_**create**.js, channel_**update**.js, channel_**delete**.js)

In the next few sections, you'll find out how this system will simplify your life when it comes to
creating features and managing databases.
