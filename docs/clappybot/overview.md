# 👀 Overview

[Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) makes it possible to develop incredible bots. However, as we add new functionalities, our code tends to become more and more “unnecessarily” loaded or disorganized.

ClappyBot offers a solution to this problem by providing a system that will manage the various elements of the discord API for you, while importing all your functionality in the form of “modules”.

A module is a grouping of commands and other interactions of the same theme. For example, we could group the commands “/ban”, “/kick”, etc. under a single module called “moderation”.

This framework will therefore enable you to create numerous modules quickly and easily, without worrying about importing them or other issues such as database linking, so that you can concentrate solely on adding functionality and not on the surrounding system.

In the next lecture you will learn how to build your clappybot from scratch, but you can also check out [⏬️ Include in an existing project](/clappybot/include)
if you already have a project and you just want to add clappybot's functionalities.
