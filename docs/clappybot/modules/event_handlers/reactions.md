# üé≠ Reactions

## üéä Multi events

There is 2 kinds of events here:
- [` MessageReactionAdd `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/Client:Class#messageReactionAdd) ‚Üí when a reaction is added to a message
- [` MessageReactionDelete `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/Client:Class#messageReactionDelete) ‚Üí when a reaction is removed from a message

Since we have 3 kinds of events, we can no longer simply put them in ` ./sources/modules/<module_name>/channels `,
we need to specify which of the 3 events is to be used. To do this, we add an *extension* to the end of the file: 
- ` add ` ‚Üí to handle [` MessageReactionAdd `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/Client:Class#messageReactionAdd)
- ` remove ` ‚Üí to handle [` MessageReactionDelete `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/Client:Class#messageReactionDelete)

‚éØ **Example for each classes**
*replace ` <module_name> ` by the name of your module*
- ` add ` ‚Üí ` ./sources/modules/<module_name>/reactions/add.js `
- ` remove ` ‚Üí ` ./sources/modules/<module_name>/channels/remove.js `

## ü§î "MessageReaction"

[` MessageReaction `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/MessageReaction:Class) is an object with several data and methods, you should read 
[discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/docs/) to see
how to work with [` MessageReaction `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/MessageReaction:Class).

## ‚ûï MessageReactionAdd

Has two arguments ` reaction ` who is an instance of [` MessageReaction `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/MessageReaction:Class)
and ` user ` who is an instance of [` User `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/User:Class).
```js
async function parse(reaction, user)
{
	console.log(message.author.username, "reacted with", reaction)
}

module.exports = {
	parse,
	conditions: [],
	any_guild: false,
	dm: false,
	allow_bots: false
}
```

## ‚ûñ MessageReactionRemove

Has two arguments ` reaction ` who is an instance of [` MessageReaction `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/MessageReaction:Class)
and ` user ` who is an instance of [` User `](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.19.3/User:Class).
```js
async function parse(reaction, user)
{
	console.log("reaction of", message.author.username, "has been removed", reaction)
}

module.exports = {
	parse,
	conditions: [],
	any_guild: false,
	dm: false,
	allow_bots: false
}
```
## üñ•Ô∏è Methods and settings

At the bottom of the file we have exports, which includes several important elements.
```js
module.exports = {
	parse,
	conditions: [],
	any_guild: false,
	dm: false,
	allow_bots: false
}
```

- ` parse ` ‚Üí method to handle the event
- ` conditions ` ‚Üí list of methods to check if ` reaction ` and ` user ` has the right conditions
- ` any_guild ` ‚Üí  if false, the command can be executed only on the main guild
- ` dm ` ‚Üí  if true, we can use this command in direct messages
- ` allow_bots ` ‚Üí  if false, it will ignore events when the user is a bot
