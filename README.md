# üëÄ What is this ?

This is the source code for [ClappyDocs](https://docs.clappycrew.com), i.e. the website that 
provides information on everything you need to know about ClappyCrew's opensource projects.

For now, this page only contains informations about [ClappyBot](https://github.com/LeWeeky/clappybot) but there are more projects to come!
